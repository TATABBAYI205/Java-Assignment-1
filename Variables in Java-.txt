Variables in Java:-
==================
There are three types of variables in Java are mentioned below:

-> Local Variables
-> Instance Variables
-> Static Variables

Local Variables: These variables are declared within a method, constructor, or a block of code and are only accessible within that scope. 
                 They must be initialized before they are used.

Instance Variables (Non-Static Variables): These variables are declared within a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. 
                   Each instance of the class has its own copy of instance variables. They are initialized with default values if not 
                   explicitly assigned.

Static Variables (Class Variables): These variables are declared with the "static" keyword and belong to the class rather than instances
                  of the class. They are shared among all instances of the class. Static variables are initialized with default values if 
                  not explicitly assigned.
