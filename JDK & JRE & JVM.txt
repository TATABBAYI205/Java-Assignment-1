JDK (Java Development Kit):-
=========================
-> JDK is a software development kit that provides tools and libraries necessary for developing Java applications.
-> It includes the Java compiler (javac) to compile Java source code into bytecode, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), 
   and various development tools like debuggers, profilers, and documentation.
-> JDK is primarily used by Java developers for writing, compiling, and packaging Java applications.
-> It is required if you want to develop Java applications.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment):-
==============================
-> JRE is an environment that provides the necessary runtime support for executing Java applications.
-> It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the core Java class libraries required for running Java programs.
-> JRE does not contain development tools such as compilers and debuggers, as its main purpose is to run already compiled 
   Java applications.
-> JRE is needed if you want to run Java applications on your system.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine):-
==========================
-> JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It is a crucial part of the Java platform's architecture.
-> When you compile Java source code, it is transformed into platform-independent bytecode, which can be executed by any JVM.
-> JVM is responsible for loading and executing bytecode, performing memory management (garbage collection), handling exceptions, 
   and providing runtime environment for Java applications.
-> JVM implementations exist for different operating systems, allowing Java programs to run on diverse platforms without needing 
   recompilation.
-> JVM is part of both the JDK and JRE.
