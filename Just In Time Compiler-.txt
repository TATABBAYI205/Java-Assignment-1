Just In Time Compiler:-
======================
-> The JIT or Just-In-Time compiler is an essential part of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), 
   that is responsible for performance optimization of java based applications during run time. 
-> In order to improve performance, JIT compilers interact with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 
   at run time and compile suitable bytecode sequences into native machine code. 
-> While using a JIT compiler, the hardware is able to execute the native code, as compared to 
   having the JVM interpret the same sequence of bytecode repeatedly and incurring overhead for 
   the translation process. 
-> This subsequently leads to performance gains in the execution speed, unless the compiled 
   methods are executed less frequently.
