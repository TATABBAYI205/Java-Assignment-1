Process:      -> Translates entire source code into machine       | -> Analyzes and executes source code line by line 
                 code or bytecode before execution.               |    or statement by statement.

Translation:  -> Performs compilation to generate an executable   | -> Translates and executes the code on-the-fly during 
                 file (bytecode) that can be run directly.        |    runtime without generating a separate executable.

Performance:  -> Generally faster execution due to optimized      | -> Typically slower execution as code is analyzed and 
                 machine code or bytecode.                        |    executed during runtime.

Portability:  -> Compiled code may be platform-specific and       | -> Interpreted code is usually more portable, running on 
                 require recompilation for different platforms.	  |    any platform with a compatible interpreter.

Debuggin:     -> Error messages are often generated during the    | -> Immediate feedback during runtime with specific error messages, 
                 compilation process. Debugging compiled code     |    aiding debugging at the statement level.        
                 often involves using debuggers on the executable.|

Examples:     -> Java source code compiled into bytecode with the | -> Java source code executed using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
