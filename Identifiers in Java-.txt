Identifiers in Java:-
====================
              In programming languages, identifiers are used for identification purposes. In Java, an identifier can be 
              a class name, method name, variable name, or label.

*)Rules for defining Java Identifiers:-
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-> There are certain rules for defining a valid java identifier. These rules must be followed, otherwise we get compile-time error. 
   These rules are also valid for other languages like C,C++. 
-> The only allowed characters for identifiers are all alphanumeric characters([A-Z],[a-z],[0-9]), ‘$‘(dollar sign) and ‘_‘ (underscore).
   For example “geek@” is not a valid java identifier as it contain ‘@’ special character.
-> Identifiers should not start with digits([0-9]). For example “123geeks” is a not a valid java identifier.
-> Java identifiers are case-sensitive.
-> There is no limit on the length of the identifier but it is advisable to use an optimum length of 4 – 15 letters only.
-> Reserved Words can’t be used as an identifier. For example “int while = 20;” is an invalid statement as while is a reserved word. 
   There are 53 reserved words in Java.
