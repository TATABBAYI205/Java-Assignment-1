Data types in java:-
==================
Java provides a variety of built-in data types that are used to define variables, constants, and method return types.
There are 2 types of data types in java

1) Primitive datatypes:-
"""""""""""""""""""""""
Primitive data are only single values and have no special capabilities.  There are 8 primitive data types.
                    |->byte: Represents a small integer value ranging from -128 to 127.
                    |->short: Represents a short integer value ranging from -32,768 to 32,767.
                    |->int: Represents an integer value ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
                    |->long: Represents a long integer value ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
                    |->float: Represents a single-precision floating-point value.
                    |->double: Represents a double-precision floating-point value.
                    |->char: Represents a single character enclosed in single quotes (e.g., 'A', 'b', '$').
                    |->boolean: Represents a boolean value, either true or false.

2) Non-primitive datatypes:-
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The Reference Data Types will contain a memory address of variable values because the reference types wonâ€™t store the variable value 
directly in memory. They are strings, objects, arrays, etc.
